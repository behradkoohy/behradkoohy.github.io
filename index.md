I'm a second year PhD student, undertaking a project in collaboration with Siemens Mobility on "Artificial Intelligence and Mechanism Design for Optimal Routing of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles". I am supervised by Dr Stein and Dr Gerding within the School of Electronics and Computer Science at the University of Southampton. Prior to undertaking a PhD, I graduated from the University of Southampton with a BSc in Computer Science. In my third year as an undergraduate, I worked with a local hospital to create a new matching algorithm for allocation of doctors and clinical staff to radiotherapy patients.

I'm particularly interested in machine learning, game theory and mechanism design in the area of intelligent traffic systems. For the past two years, I've worked part time throughout my studies in a web dev/dev ops role for the University of Southampton.
